        The Lord of the Rings trilogy contains one of the most heroic and daring adventures ever undertaken. A small band of hobbits lead by Frodo Baggins set out from their home to transport the most evil item, the ring of power, in all of Middle Earth in hopes of aiding in its destruction. After reaching an elvish safe haven, Lorien, a fellowship of nine which consisted of men, hobbits, an elf, a dwarf, and a wizard, was appointed to destroy the ring by going to the land of Mordor and casting it into the Mountain of Fire, destroying it and its power forever. Throughout the course of the story, the nine that set out from Lorien were separated and found their own paths of aiding in the battle. In hopes of understanding how the relationships between the members of the fellowship morphed and changed over the course of their adventure, understanding the frequency that they spoke to each other may lend helpful in understanding how their relationships changed.
